Serial Mode - Technical Specification</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><br>
The USB-ISS has a 30 byte data buffer for serial transmit and a 62 byte buffer for
serial&nbsp;receive.<br>
The command format is:</p>

<table border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFCC" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">SERIAL_IO command (0x62)</td>
    <td align="center"> TxData1</td>
    <td align="center"> TxData2</td>
    <td align="center"> TxData3</td>
    <td align="center"> TxData4</td>
    <td align="center"> ...</td>
    <td align="center"> TxData n</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Characters sent for transmission are buffered and sent as soon as possible. The
command does not wait for the characters to be transmitted before
responding.&nbsp;<br>
The response&nbsp; frame is:<br>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFCC" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">ACK (0xFF) or NACK (0x00)</td>
    <td align="center">TxCount</td>
    <td align="center">RxCount</td>
    <td align="center">RxData1</td>
    <td align="center">RxData2</td>
    <td align="center">...</td>
    <td align="center">RxData n</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The only reason you will ever get a NACK is if the buffer
does not have enough room for the transmit characters. You must wait until there
is room in the buffer and then send them again, or better still check there is
room in the buffer before you send them. The next two bytes are the
number of characters remaining in the transmit buffer (TxCount) and the number
of receive characters that follow (RxCount). You should always read these three
bytes first. You should next examine the RxCount byte and receive that number of
characters. If the RxCount byte is zero then there are no further characters to
receive.</p>

<p align="left">It is valid to send the SERIAL_IO command (0x62) on its own,
without any Tx characters. That is how you will check for any received
characters if you have nothing to transmit. You will get the same response frame
as above.</p>
